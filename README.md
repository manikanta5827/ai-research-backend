## This project is about how a llm would operate when a user send a query
## It searches for the user query in different articles by web scrawling and then fetch the content and summarise it
## our application works on the same way , when user searches for a query it searches for top 5 articles and fetch the content of each article and summarises each article using llm and at last generates a single summary and keywords
